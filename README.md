# Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.


## About

* This project consists of three main pages; `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Each page uses Bootstrap in order to better ensure that page elements are mobile responsive.

* The `index.html` page consists of:

   * An `About Me` section with an image and a short bio.

* The `portfolio.html` page consists of:

   * A `Gallery` of some sort with repeating images overlaid with links. This is to be filled in later with your projects!

* The `contact.html` page consists of:

   * A basic form for anyone who wants to send a message.
